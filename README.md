# PHP Technical Test

The objective of this test is to measure how well you know PHP language and best practices but also your creativity.

## 1.	Submission rules :

When you have completed your exercise, open a Pull Request with your code and an INSTRUCTIONS.md file explaining how to run your code work (compose install, artisan ...). Your instructions must be clear and enable anyone to run your project without errors or warnings.

-	You can provide a docker file, a Vagrant box or simply instructions for MAMP.
-	Your code should include comments if necessary.
-	You are free to use the Framework or the libraries of your choice, remember that here you have to show your skills, not the efficiency of a technology, only your code and the final rendering will be taken into account. It is therefore useless to pile up libraries if *your* code is only ten lines long.
-	Impose a standard, think genericity, simplicity of the code. Imagine that this code will then be given to other developers who will have to use it without being able to talk to you.

## 2.	The exercise :

Your submission must include two pages:

The first one a simple input field allowing you to enter any number from 0 to 99 and a submission button.
The second one, a grid of 1000x1000 `<div>` of 1px by 1px where the previously entered number must be displayed.

## 3.	Help and explanations :

This is a "creative" exercise : the code has no “real” use. It is about you, which solution you are going to invent and how you are going to implement it. You will have to go through several steps, think "bitmap" (although this is not the only approach).

"Prerendering" the numbers and displaying them isn't a valid answer.

Estimated time: For a confirmed level developer, this project takes about 1h30. If you are a junior, try not to take more than 2h30.
